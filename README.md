#### Web Development

👋 Hello, I'm Khalid Ali, a passionate software developer with a strong focus on web development. My journey began with HTML and CSS, and I've since expanded my skills to include Java. During my time at university, I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects, exploring various programming languages and technologies.

🚀 Currently, I'm immersing myself in JavaScript, aiming to master it for web development. My goal is to become a successful web developer, and I'm excited to graduate in 2024, ready to bring my skills to the professional world.

🌐 I'm always eager to learn and collaborate, so feel free to connect with me and join me on my web development journey!
